## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
None

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I found this program very late, but I was incredibly intrigued by the opportunties that it could provide a fledgling software developer like myself. Nevertheless I got a late start on the application and on the prework. Therefore, the biggest challenge to me was time in this scenario. Luckily, I have
a decent amount of history with HTML and was able to follow the instructions quite quickly. However, a challenge that I did face was not creating the additional features! Since I found the program just yesterday, I did not have the time to add all the features that I would liked to have. In a sense,
this was a test of self control in terms of focusing on the project to make sure I completed the necessary parts on time!

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I have long wondered how some of the fancier elements of web design are created (the most elegant examples I can imagine come from apple.com). With the sliding graphics and animations, I am sure that there is some technology that provides greater possibilities than the already-powerful CSS. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Firstly, I would certainly add the optional features! After that, I would like to dig deeper into the sound functions and explore the syntax behind those elements. While the tutorial gave a great general overview, I would love to dig into the weeds and see if I could replace the dial tones with
one of my favorite songs.
